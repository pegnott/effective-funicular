# A Repo to Reproduce & Troubleshoot

There appears to be an issue involving [snowpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowpack), and material-ui, specifically seeming to be triggered by a combination of an update to snowpack and the use of a specific material component, [ToggleButtonGroup](https://material-ui.com/api/toggle-button-group/).

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
